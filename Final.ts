/*
    For ease of use with GSAP I added in the integration plug in on JSbin as
    well as imported it on my local PC, I've used VSCode as my Text Editor
    for this.

    Also a few notes:
    - As has been alluded to several times in this doc, JSBin's version
        of TypeScript isn't up to date, as such there's a few bit's of
        syntax I'm not exactly happy with but had to adapt to work in JSBin
        as requested; but I'm sure I have forgotten more pieces I had to change.
    - For example, I would have liked to wrap most of the GSAP methods in a promise,
        however JSBin didnt seem to like it when I tried to use spread/rest
        syntax, although that could have just been me not doing it correctly.
        I'll have to give the clichÃ© here of "it worked on my machine"
    - Nullish operators not being present was another feature I am used to
        using but wasn't able to. In its' place I have had to use OR operators.
        I'm not over the moon about this, but for demonstration purposes it works.
        Fun fact for whoever is assessing this btw, nullish operators are called
        elvis operators in Kotlin

    other more interesting functionality.
